Key Differences:

1 Purpose: HTML is for structuring content, while JavaScript is for creating interactive and dynamic behavior.

2 Functionality: HTML provides the static content and structure of a webpage, while JavaScript adds interactivity, manipulation, and behavior to that content.

3 Language Type: HTML is a markup language, while JavaScript is a programming language.

4 Execution: HTML is parsed and rendered by the browser, displaying content, while JavaScript is executed by the browser to add interactivity and functionality.

Situations where you would use each:

HTML: Use HTML to define the structure and content of a webpage. For instance, when creating the basic layout of a webpage, adding text, images, links, and other static elements.

JavaScript: Use JavaScript when you need to add interactive features or behavior to a webpage, like creating dynamic content, handling user inputs, performing validation, making API requests, or manipulating the DOM based on user actions.

In practice, HTML and JavaScript work together, with HTML creating the foundation and structure of a webpage, while JavaScript brings that structure to life by adding interactivity and dynamic behavior.
