What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them using the'let' keyword?

Solution-->
We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data. To create a variable in JavaScript, use the let keyword. To be concise, we can combine the variable declaration and assignment into a single line:

 let message = 'Hello!';
let age = 20 ;
