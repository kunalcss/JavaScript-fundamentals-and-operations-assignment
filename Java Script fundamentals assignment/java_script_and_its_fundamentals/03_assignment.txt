 List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.

 Solution-->

1 Number: The Number type represents numeric data, including integers and floating-point numbers. In JavaScript, all numbers, whether integers or floating-point, are of the type Number.

Example:
let integerNumber = 10;
let floatNumber = 3.14;

2 String: The String type represents a sequence of characters, enclosed in single (' ') or double (" ") quotes. Strings are used for text and are immutable (cannot be changed once created).

Example:
let greeting = 'Hello, world!';
let name = "Alice";


3 Boolean: The Boolean type represents a logical entity, either true or false. Booleans are commonly used for conditional testing and control flow in JavaScript.

Example:
let isTrue = true;
let isFalse = false;

4 Null: The Null type has only one value, which is null. It represents the intentional absence of any object value.

Example:
let nullValue = null;

5 Undefined: it means the value is not defined yet.
Example:
let UndefinedValue = Undefined yet;
