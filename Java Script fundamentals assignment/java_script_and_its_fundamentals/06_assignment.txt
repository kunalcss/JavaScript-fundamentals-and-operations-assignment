6: Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript.
Provide an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability.

Solution-->
Importance of Descriptive Variable Names:

1 Readability and Comprehension: Meaningful names immediately convey the purpose or content of a variable. They reduce the need for additional comments to explain the role of the variable.

2 Maintainability: Descriptive names make code maintenance easier. When revisiting code later or working in a team, clear identifiers help you quickly understand the code's intent and functionality.

3 Reduced Bugs and Errors: Clear variable names can help prevent errors and bugs by making the code more self-explanatory, reducing the chances of misinterpreting the purpose of a variable.

Example:

Unclear Variable Names:
javascript
Copy code
let a = 25;
let b = 10;
let c = a + b;
In this code, it might not be immediately obvious what a, b, or c represent. The code lacks clarity, making it harder to understand the purpose of these variables and their relation to the calculation.

Descriptive Variable Names:
javascript
Copy code
let firstNumber = 25;
let secondNumber = 10;
let sum = firstNumber + secondNumber;
