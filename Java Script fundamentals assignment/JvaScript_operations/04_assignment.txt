Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these concepts important?

Solution-->
Operator Precedence:
Operator precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated when an expression contains multiple operators. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first.

For instance, in the expression 5 + 3 * 2, multiplication has a higher precedence than addition in JavaScript. Therefore, the multiplication (3 * 2) is performed first, resulting in 5 + 6, which evaluates to 11.

Associativity:
Associativity defines the order in which operators of the same precedence are executed. It specifies whether an expression is processed from left to right (left-associative) or right to left (right-associative) when operators have the same precedence.

For example, in the expression 6 / 2 / 3, division is left-associative. This means the expression is evaluated from left to right: (6 / 2) first, resulting in 3. Then, 3 / 3 is evaluated, resulting in 1.


Understanding of these is important because -->

Correct Evaluation: Understanding precedence and associativity ensures that expressions are evaluated correctly according to the intended order of operations.

Avoiding Errors: Misunderstanding precedence or associativity can lead to errors or unexpected results in computations.

Code Clarity: It helps in writing code that is more readable and easier to understand, especially in complex expressions involving multiple operators.
