Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.

Solution-->

Unary Operators:
Unary operators are operators that act on a single operand, meaning they work with only one value or variable.

Examples of Unary Operators:

Increment (++) and Decrement (--):
let counter = 10;

// Increment operator (++)
counter++; // Adds 1 to the value: Result: 11

// Decrement operator (--)
counter--; // Subtracts 1 from the value: Result: 10
Binary Operators:
Binary operators work with two operands, performing an operation that involves two values or variables.

Examples of Binary Operators:

Addition (+) and Subtraction (-):

let a = 10;
let b = 5;

// Addition operator
let sum = a + b; // Result: 15

// Subtraction operator
let difference = a - b; // Result: 5
Multiplication (*), Division (/), and Modulus (%):

let x = 12;
let y = 3;

// Multiplication operator
let product = x * y; // Result: 36

// Division operator
let quotient = x / y; // Result: 4

// Modulus operator (remainder of division)
let remainder = x % y; // Result: 0


Ternary Operator:
The ternary operator is unique in that it is the only operator that takes three operands: a condition, a value returned if the condition is true, and a value returned if the condition is false.

Example of Ternary Operator
let age = 20;

// Ternary operator (? :)
let message = (age < 18) ? 'Too young to vote' : 'Old enough to vote';
console.log(message); // Output: 'Old enough to vote'
